 <h1>Azie P, My first website</h1>
 <h2>This poem does or does not reflect my current feelings </h2>

    In a room, doomed of loneliness <br>
    With light switched off to darkness, <br>
    My shadow, scattered on the wall. <br>
    I am well trying to balance <br>
    How I ended feeling so dull in my soul. <br>
    There is no music playing, no people talking, no children playing around. <br>
    Its just me and my shadow. <br>
    At some point, I wish it could literally <br>
    Lend me its ears, <br>
    So that it can know how pierced is my heart.
